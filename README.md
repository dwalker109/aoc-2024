# Advent of Code 2024 !!! 

Well, here we are again. Another year, another promise to myself that I'll respect my own
time and bail out once I get tired of it. We'll see how that goes. I'm using Rust again, 
because it's fun, and it's where I'm most productive. Deps are fine. 

Solutions all expect inputs to be found in the `./input` directory, at the project root.
